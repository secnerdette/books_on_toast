As lovers of books and books converted to screen, you can bet we're crazy excited about it. So we decided to do a trailer review and talk about how the visuals compare to our imagination. Produced by Peter Jackson, who is no stranger to adaptations as know, and directed by Christian Rivers, we're super, duper looking forward to this movie.\n\nMortal Engines is set in a post-apocalyptic world destroyed by a cataclysmic war, in a time when giant predator cities exist and they devour the smaller towns so as to accumulate their resources. This is called Municipal Darwinism. Trying to stop all these cities from destroying whatever is left of the Earth's resources, is the Anti-Traction league. Our hero is Hester Shaw, a girl hell-bent on seeking revenge for what she happened to her and her family, and Tom Natsworthy, a 16-year-old Londoner who gets caught in between, and gets thrown out of the only home he's ever known - the traction city of London.

{"id": "qqJiLjsiWyo", "title": "The Clueless Critic with Kunal Kamra feat. Samit Basu:  Brands and Stress", "details": "What happens when a comedian who has never read a book roasts author extraordinaire Samit Basu? Why, he roasts him back, of course. \n\nBooks by Samit Basu: \nThe Simoqin Prophecies\nBuy: http://amzn.to/2osOfTM\nThe Manticore's Secret \nBuy: http://amzn.to/2oXIheJ\nThe Unwaba Revelations\nBuy: http://amzn.to/2pl4c2y\nTurbulence \nBuy: http://amzn.to/2owJXtN\nResistance\nBuy: http://amzn.to/2oXJQZW \nThe Adventures of Stoob: Testing Times \nBuy: http://amzn.to/2ob679R\nThe Adventures of Stoob: A Difficult Stage\nBuy: http://amzn.to/2oXF92y\n\n\nAbout Samit Basu: \n\nSamit Basu is a writer of books, films and comics. His first novel, The Simoqin Prophecies, published by Penguin India in 2003, when Samit was 23, was the first book in the bestselling Gameworld Trilogy and marked the beginning of Indian English fantasy writing. The other books in the trilogy are The Manticore\u2019s Secret and The Unwaba Revelations.\n\nSamit\u2019s global breakthrough happened with the superhero novels Turbulence and Resistance. Turbulence was published in the UK in 2012 and in the US in 2013 to rave reviews. It won Wired\u2018s Goldenbot Award as one of the books of 2012 and was superheronovels.com\u2019s Book of the Year for 2013. Its sequel, Resistance was published in the UK/US in 2014 and was just as well received.\n\nSamit also writes for younger readers: other works include the ongoing Morningstar Agency and Adventures of Stoob series.\n\nSamit\u2019s work in comics ranges from historical romance to zombie comedy, and includes diverse collaborators, from X-Men/Felix Castor writer Mike Carey to Terry Gilliam and Duran Duran. His latest GN, Local Monsters, was published in 2013. He\u2019s currently working on a number of book, TV, film, comics and new media projects.\n\nSamit was born in Calcutta, educated in Calcutta and London, and currently divides his time between Delhi and Mumbai. He can be found on Twitter, @samitbasu, and at samitbasu.com\n\nAbout Kunal Kamra: \nKunal Kamra has a career in advertising which has made him so jaded and frustrated that he does stand up in order to satisfy his need to ridicule and mock what he sees in his daily life. He's an observational comedian, and is known for his weird and twisted take on things.
