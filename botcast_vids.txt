{"id": "0SyrLIGOeY0", "title": "Mortal Engines - Movie by Peter Jackson: Trailer Review", "details": "Mortal Engines, a movie based on a steampunk cult favourite series by Philip Reeves, IS RELEASING DECEMBER 7TH! As lovers of books and books converted to screen, you can bet we're crazy excited about it. So we decided to do a trailer review and talk about how the visuals compare to our imagination. Produced by Peter Jackson, who is no stranger to adaptations as know, and directed by Christian Rivers, we're super, duper looking forward to this movie.\n\nMortal Engines is set in a post-apocalyptic world destroyed by a cataclysmic war, in a time when giant predator cities exist and they devour the smaller towns so as to accumulate their resources. This is called Municipal Darwinism. Trying to stop all these cities from destroying whatever is left of the Earth's resources, is the Anti-Traction league. Our hero is Hester Shaw, a girl hell-bent on seeking revenge for what she happened to her and her family, and Tom Natsworthy, a 16-year-old Londoner who gets caught in between, and gets thrown out of the only home he's ever known - the traction city of London. What follows is a saga of sci-fi, intrigue, action and adventure. \n\nCheck out the movie trailer here: https://youtu.be/--h378d0ju0\n\nBuy Mortal Engines:\nPaperback: https://amzn.to/2TYNP7W\nKindle edition: https://amzn.to/2Q0JuCR\n\nLink to Soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/booksontoast \nLink to Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/booksontoast \n\nThank you to our current Patrons: Vaishnavi S, Meenakshi Venkataraman, Hiral A Chauhan.\n\nBooks on Toast is a channel where we discuss literature: the good, the bad, the time pass, the serious, the best, the worst and everything else in between.
